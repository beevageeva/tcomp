The program must be written in python (2.7 or higher) with the following characteristics:
It must read a file containing, for each column: xi , yi and σi (standard deviations of the dependent variable).
It must be possible to select the degree of the polynomial to be fitted.
It must be an option to use σi or not in the fit.
It must solve the coefficients of the fit using a least-squares procedure by using arrays (NOT any built-in python function for fitting).
The goodness of the fit (R-squared) must be shown.
It must give the standard deviations for each coefficient and the average standard deviation of the fit.
Main procedures in the program must be described using comments to  easily  follow the flow of the code.
To test the program, the files  datafit1.dat, datafit2.dat, and datafit3.dat can be used. The results of the fit to these files can be found in the readme.txt file.
